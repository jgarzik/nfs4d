Various to-do items
-------------------
cred-based access checks (not just share reservations and locks; OPEN20)
GSSAPI
Delegations
Lock upgrade, downgrade
Open upgrade
LOCKU on unlocked area should return NFS4_OK
"fair" locking for blocking locks
overlapping locks
test: OPDG2
	OPENDOWNGRADE to never opened mode should return
	NFS4ERR_INVAL, instead got NFS4_OK
test: OPEN2
	Attrs on recreate should be ignored: For mode expected
	420, got 384
test: RLOWN1
	OP_RELEASE_LOCKOWNER should return NFS4_OK, instead
	got NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD
replay cache for open/lock/etc.
open exclusive: bitmap-out should indicate which attr we used for
	storing create verifier?


Maybe
-----
LOCKU inside a locked area should return OK
ditch GNet for epoll?
